                        We would like to begin by expressing our heartfelt gratitude to our FYP coordinator, Sir Irfan Ali Khandharo. His unwavering support, guidance, and encouragement have been instrumental in the successful completion of our project. Without his mentorship, our journey would not have been as enriching and fulfilling.

                        Our journey began a year ago, with a shared vision and a common goal among the three of usâ€”Abdul Moiz, Muhammad Saif, and myself, Muhammad Shabbir. As students of Computer Science at SMIU University, we embarked on this research project with immense enthusiasm but zero data. The road ahead was uncertain, filled with numerous challenges and learning opportunities, but we were determined to make a significant contribution to the field of language processing and machine learning.

                        Our initial phase was marked by an intensive data collection process. With no existing datasets available for our specific requirements, we had to start from scratch. We began by identifying reliable sources from which we could scrape data. This involved countless hours of searching, validating, and gathering raw data from various online repositories, books, articles, and other textual resources. The process was arduous and time-consuming, but it was a crucial first step towards our goal.
